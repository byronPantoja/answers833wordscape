# Wordscapes Answers

A fast and responsive web application built with Next.js that provides players with the answers and solutions for the popular mobile game, Wordscapes.

## Description

This project is a web-based guide for the game Wordscapes. It allows users to easily navigate through the different tiers, sections, and levels of the game to find the answers they are looking for. The application is built using modern web technologies with a focus on performance and user experience, leveraging Next.js for Static Site Generation (SSG) to ensure lightning-fast load times.

## Features

  * **Browse by Tier:** Answers are organized into the main tiers of the game (e.g., Jungle, Ocean, etc.).
  * **Section and Level Navigation:** Easily drill down from a tier to a specific section and level number.
  * **Clear Answer Display:** View all word answers for a given level in a clean, grid-based layout.
  * **Responsive Design:** A mobile-first design that works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
  * **Extremely Fast:** Built with Next.js and Static Site Generation (SSG), pages are pre-built and load instantly.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js structure with a clear separation of concerns.

```
.
├── components/         # Reusable React components used across the application
├── data/               # Contains the application's data (levels.json) and utility functions
├── pages/              # Next.js pages and routing structure
│   ├── api/            # API routes
│   └── ...
├── public/             # Static assets like favicons

```

  * **`/components`**: Contains all the reusable UI components like `Header`, `TierCard`, `LevelCard`, etc. Each component is responsible for a specific piece of the UI.
  * **`/data`**: Holds the core game data in `levels.json` and a `dataUtils/answersData.js` helper to provide functions for accessing and manipulating that data.
  * **`/pages`**: Defines the application's routes. The file-based routing of Next.js is used here, including dynamic routes (`[TiersPage].js`) and catch-all routes (`[[...answers]].js`) to handle the different URL structures.
  * **`/styles`**: Contains global styles and CSS configurations.
